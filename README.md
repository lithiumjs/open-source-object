# Open Source Object

## FAQ:

> What is this?

In the `open_source_object.json` there is a valid JSON object. And also, it's completely open source!

> What can I do with it?

I dunno, you can download it and modify it to your heart's content. Or not. I'm just a README.

> How can I contribute to it?

Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/lithiumjs/open-source-object/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get more information on how to contribute.

> Does this have any purpose?

No. It's just a joke I decided to make in my free time.

## LICENSE

[WTFPL](https://github.com/lithiumjs/open-source-object/blob/master/LICENSE). TL;DR: You can do whatever the fuck you want with this.
